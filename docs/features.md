# Features

## API Manager

The API Manager is the core of the APEX Cloud API management solution. It is a self-service admin console that allows API publishers to manage the life cycle of their APIs, from registration to retirement of APIs. It also allows API consumers to discover and subscribe to APIs, as well as manage their application credentials. The settings configured through the API manager are then applied to the API gateway.

## API Gateway

The API gateway is the core infrastructure that provides security and connectivity between APIs and their consumers. It is the “front-door” that sits between the clients and the backend services that it provides security for. It takes API calls from clients and routes them to the correct backend services.

## API Builder

The API Builder is an open-source, Node.js software that acts as an integration and orchestration layer between APEX Cloud and any existing service providers. It comes with a low/no-code approach and a rich set of ready-to-use libraries that allows users to develop integration use cases much faster than when implementing them manually.

## API Portal

The API Portal is a web-based portal that enables external, non-government developers to discover and consume APIs that government agencies have exposed. It comes with self-service features that allow developers to browse and test APIs as well as manage their application credentials and monitor their API usages through graphs and charts.

## API Monitoring

The API manager also comes with real-time API monitoring which allows users to analyse their API use and discover insights and trends.
